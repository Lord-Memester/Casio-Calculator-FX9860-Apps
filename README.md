# Casio Graphing Calculator Fx9860 Apps

_A collection of apps and games made for the Casio Fx9860 series of calculators_

These are some of the programs I made in highschool for the Casio Fx9750GII, though they should work for any calculator in the Fx9860 series.

## Installation

For each program, I have provided the G1M file and the source code.

To install a program, you will need to import the G1M file into the [FA-124](https://edu.casio.com/forteachers/er/software/) program for windows. You will need a USB link cable to connect to your calculator. _Some programs require additional picture files, or rely upon other programs to run._

All programs will appear locked on the calculator. This is to prevent accidental code changes when you exit a program.
The passwords are all "`LOCK`".

### About Program Source Code

When a Casio BASIC program is opened in FA-124 for editing, the editor correctly displays unusual characters like `‚áí` and `√∑` correctly. However, when text is copied out of the editor, it becomes a different unicode character. (`‚áí` and `√∑` become `√ó` and `√Å`, for example)
To make my source code readable, I've put the text through a substitution cipher to transform _the most common_ of these symbols to unicode equivalents.

If you wanted to transform the source code back into text for the FA-124 editor, you could apply this substitution in reverse, although I would recommend sticking to the G1M file, and making any changes in the FA-124 editor.

Substitutions:

    √ô
    √ó	‚áí
    √ò	‚ó¢
    √à	‚â†
    √ä	‚â•
    √â	‚â§
    √£	‚Üí
    √¶	œÄ
    √ã	‚àö
    √Ä	√ó
    √Å	√∑
    √é	‚Åª
    ¬ª	‚åü
    √§	Œ∏
    ¬Ω	ùê¢
    ¬º	ùóò
    ¬´	xÃÑ

_Note: These aren't all of the characters, only the most common ones._
