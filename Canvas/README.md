# Canvas

This is a text drawing program

`CANVAS` is used to draw

`CANVAIMG` recalls the image afterwards

_Both programs require `-CNVSDRW` to map keycodes to symbols_

## Controls

All letter keys will place a letter under the cursor.
The cursor can be moved with the arrow keys.
Use `DEL` to erase.
All other keys apart from `SHIFT` and `ALPHA` place misc symbols.
