ABOUT
-----

Clock is a simple utility
that keeps track of the
time, month and day. It
uses the fx-9860 RTC
(Real-Time Clock) to
function. This add-in
is written in both
assembly and C. Even when
you turn off your calc-
culator it will still
keep track of time.

---
USE
---

Just download it into
your calculator using
FA-124. When running
the add-in, it will
display the seconds,
minutes, hour, day and
month. To exit out of the
add-in, press [EXIT].

SETTING THE TIME
----------------

When running the add-in
for the first time,
the time will be most
likely wrong. To change
the time, press [F1].

First thing it will ask
is for the year.

Next thing it will ask
is the month. Choose
from 1-12 for a month.

Next will be the date.
The date is the day of
the month. Choose
from 1-31.

Next will be day. Day in
the fx-9860 is different
than from our conven-
tional term of day. You
choose from 0-6 by this:

0 - Sunday
1 - Monday
2 - Tuesday
3 - Wednesday
4 - Thursday
5 - Friday
6 - Saturday

Next it will ask for
hour. Choose from 0-23.

Next will be minute.
Choose from 0-60.

Next will be second.
Choose from 0-60.

Press [EXE] and the time
will be set. Notice now
that the time has now
changed. :)

NOTES
-----

* This program uses the
RTC (Real-Time Clock)
which is built-in the
CPU. Turning off your
calculator won't erase
the time.
