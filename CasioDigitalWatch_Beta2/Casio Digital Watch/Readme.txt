Thank you for downloading Casio Digital Watch

It was created by Menno de Bes on saturday march 17 2007 using the Epsilon library created by Kucalc. 

The digital watch is quite simple to operate,

Keys:
Menu returns to main menu.
function key 1 (F1) gets you to the settings menu

in the settings menu you can use the up and down arrow to set the appropriate values
when the appropriate value is set press exe to set the next value

If you like it you can drop me an email
